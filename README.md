This is the repository for the 2nd module of the Combinatorial and Decision Making course. It aims to solve two very simple optimization problems:
- one with a linear utility function that aims to maximize the expcted return, solved by using a simplex algorithm,
- one with a quadratic utility function which aims to minimize the risk associated, solved by using a quadratic programming implementation of the interior-point algorithm [Numerical Optimization, Wright, 2006],
